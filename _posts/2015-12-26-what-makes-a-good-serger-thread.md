# What makes a good Serger thread?

There's a lot that goes into the production of thread. Serger thread is commonly associated with the bargain bin cones of thread you can purchase from your local chain store that has more fuzz than bichon frise caught in a lightening storm.

Fuzz isn't a bad thing, too much fuzz is down-right annoying though. A good serger thread has a little bit of fuzz to help the fibers of the thread form a solid stitch against fabric, is strong enough for daily abuse, and blends well with the backing fabric.

This is what makes Sergin' General a fantastic serger thread. It has a perfected amount of fuzz to reduce puckering when sewing, a strong filament polyester core to give the thread a sturdy foundation, and is available in 50 blending colors.

Once you enjoy a high-quality serging experience, it's difficult to revert to the bargain bin.
